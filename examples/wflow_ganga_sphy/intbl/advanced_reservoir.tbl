# ADVANCED RESERVOIR PARAMETERS. Create a lookup table file containing the parameters to be used for the
# reservoirs that should be modeled as advanced reservoirs, using a target release, which are defined in 
# the table shown above. Format should be as shown below. The first line should not be in the table file and 
# the # marks should be removed:
